# -Windows-XP-High-Resolution-Icon-Pack
These are the source PSDs of my DeviantArt icon pack. The files themselves may be a little sloppy. Bad organization, silly layer names, etc. But they got the job done. It was suggested I release them here on GitHub so programmers could use them for their projects.
